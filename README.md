# Berlin Transit Live Monitor

A modern, responsive web dashboard designed for real-time monitoring of public transport departures in Berlin. This tool provides a comprehensive view of transit movements, combining temporal schedules with spatial tracking.


### ♻️ Theme: Repurposing Old Phones into Schedule Displays
**Don't let your old smartphones collect dust!** This project was specifically designed and optimized to turn any spare smartphone or tablet into a dedicated, real-time smart transit monitor. By opening this dashboard in full-screen on an old device, you can create a permanent public transport timetable for your home, hallway, or office.
